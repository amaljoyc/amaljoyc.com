title: Singleton Pattern
---

## Concepts

- Only one instance created for the Singleton class.
- Examples include Runtime, Spring Beans, Graphic Managers etc.
- The class uses a private Constructor to instantiate. This is to make sure only the Singleton class calls the Constructor and nobody else.
- No parameter required for the construction of the singleton object.

## Demo

- [Singleton.java]()
- [ThreadSafeSingleton.java]()
