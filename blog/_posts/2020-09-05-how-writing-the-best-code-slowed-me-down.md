Being passionate about programming is good, but it has got its own perils. One such side effect is that you focus too much on your code quality. Don't get me wrong here, we should all strive for good quality and clean code. But the point I wanna raise is, when does it matter the most and when does it become counter productive. Here is my experience trying to be a clean coder and what I learned from it.

### How I became slow?

I used to be a programmer who tried to write the best and clean code one line at a time. If I don't feel good about a line of code I wrote, I used to rewrite it immediately until I could accept it. This went on and on and it used to take me hours before I could finish up implementing a feature.

Another reason for me being slow was due to making premature optimizations. All those abstractions that I thought in the beginning was not really necessary when I starting implementing them.

### How do I code now?

Clearly, I was wasting way too much time in the beginning, trying to come up with the most optimized and clean code at the very first attempt. I now follow a three step approach and is much faster and productive when programming.

1. `Code a working solution` as fast as I can. A solution that works is far better than a clean code that doesn't do its job properly.
2. `Optimize` the above working solution so that it is more solid and scalable. By this time, I am thinking not in terms of abstractions, but real code in front of me and that helps to make better educated decisions.
3. `Beautify` the above optimized code so that the person who is coming after me can easily read and understand the solution.
